# Weather Application
The Weather App is a Python program that allows users to retrieve real-time weather information for a specific city. Users can input the name of a city, and the app fetches data such as temperature, weather conditions, and more. The app uses the OpenWeatherMap API to provide accurate weather details.

Features:
City Input: Users can enter the name of any city worldwide.
Temperature Conversion: The app displays the temperature in both Fahrenheit and Celsius.
Error Handling: If the city name is invalid or no weather data is found, appropriate error messages are displayed.
How to Use:
Run the Python script (weather_app.py).
Enter the desired city name when prompted.
The app will fetch weather data and display it in the console or a graphical user interface (GUI).
